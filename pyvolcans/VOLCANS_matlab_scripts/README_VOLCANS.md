# VOLCano ANalogues Search (VOLCANS)

This is a README file that describes the structure and content of the Matlab scripts (Mathworks, 2012) that integrate
the VOLCANS method presented by [Tierz, Loughlin and Calder (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00445-019-1336-3).

This set of scripts was used to derive all the [analogy matrices](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans/tree/main/pyvolcans/VOLCANS_mat_files/analogy_mats)
used by `PyVOLCANS`.

Please note that the VOLCANS Matlab code is provided _as-is_: in other words, without any cleaning for public use.
The eventual aim of us, creators of `PyVOLCANS` ([@PTierz](https://github.com/PTierz), [@mobiuscreek](https://github.com/mobiuscreek),
[@volcan01010](https://github.com/volcan01010)), is to port the entire Matlab code into Python, including it as part of future releases
of the `PyVOLCANS` code.

In the following, a brief summary of the general process developed to generate the analogy matrices is provided (for more details,
please see [Tierz et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00445-019-1336-3)). This is followed by individual descriptions of the main
purpose and functioning of each of the Matlab (`.m`) files present in the current folder.

`VOLCANS` was devised by [Pablo Tierz](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/people/tierz-lopez-pablo/) ([@PTierz](https://github.com/PTierz)),
[Susan C. Loughlin](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/people/loughlin-susan/) (British Geological Survey),
and [Eliza S. Calder](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/eliza-calder) (University of Edinburgh).
All Matlab scripts were written by [Pablo Tierz](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/people/tierz-lopez-pablo/) ([@PTierz](https://github.com/PTierz)).

`PyVOLCANS` and the associated Matlab scripts are distributed under the [LGPL v3.0 licence](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans/blob/main/LICENSE).
