# PyVOLCANS

> PyVOLCANS: A Python package to flexibly explore similarities and differences between volcanic systems


## Installation instructions

PyVOLCANS can be installed from PyPI as follows:

```
pip install pyvolcans
```

This method adds `pyvolcans` to the virtual environment PATH so that it can be
used from any directory.


## Example usage

Calling PyVOLCANS with a volcano name returns the 10 top analogue volcanoes:

```
$ pyvolcans Hekla

Top 10 analogue volcanoes for Hekla, Iceland (372070):
              name       country  smithsonian_id  total_analogy
       Torfajokull       Iceland          372050       0.941676

## API documentation

Users interact with PyVOLCANS via the command-line tool.
The `--help` command describes the possible options.

```
$ pyvolcans --help

  -v, --verbose         Print debug-level logging output, and include single-
                        criterion analogy values, besides the total analogy
                        values, in the PyVOLCANS results
  -pa, --plot_apriori   Generate bar plots displaying the values of single-
                        criterion and total analogy between the target volcano
                        and any 'a priori' analogues chosen by the user.
  -S, --save_figures    Save all generated figures

```


## Community

### For users

The best way to get in touch to ask questions, submit bug reports or contribute code is by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans/issues) in this repository.

### For developers

To modify the code, first clone the PyVOLCANS repository into your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans
```

Then move to the root directory of the project (`pyvolcans`, which contains the `setup.py` file - 
please also check the `requirements.txt` file for a full list of dependencies in the code),
and run the following command to install PyVOLCANS in development mode, preferably within a
clean virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

The `-e` flag makes the files in the current working directory available
throughout the virtual environment and, therefore, changes are reflected straight away.
With this installation, it is no longer required to set the PYTHONPATH.

The `[dev]` part installs packages required for development e.g. `pytest`.

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest -v test
```

### Maintainers

`PyVOLCANS` was created by and is maintained by British Geological Survey
