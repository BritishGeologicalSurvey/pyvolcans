# PyVOLCANS

> PyVOLCANS: A Python package to flexibly explore similarities and differences between volcanic systems

The main goal of PyVOLCANS is to help alleviate data-scarcity issues in volcanology, and contribute to developments in a range of topics, including (but not limited to): quantitative volcanic hazard assessment at local to global scales, investigation of magmatic and volcanic processes, and even teaching and scientific outreach. We hope that future users of PyVOLCANS will include any volcano scientist or enthusiast with an interest in exploring the similarities and differences between volcanic systems worldwide. Please visit our [wiki pages](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans/wiki) for more information.

## Installation instructions

PyVOLCANS can be installed from PyPI as follows:

```
pip install pyvolcans
```

This method adds `pyvolcans` to the virtual environment PATH so that it can be
used from any directory.


## API documentation and example usage

Users interact with PyVOLCANS via the command-line tool. The `--help` command describes the possible options.

```
$ pyvolcans --help

  -St ERUPTION_STYLE, --eruption_style ERUPTION_STYLE
                        Set eruption style weight (e.g. '0.2' or '1/5')
  --count COUNT         Set the number of top analogue volcanoes
  -w, --write_csv_file  Write list of top analogue volcanoes as .csv file
  -W, --website         Open GVP website for top analogue volcano
  -v, --verbose         Print debug-level logging output, and include single-
                        criterion analogy values, besides the total analogy
                        values, in the PyVOLCANS results
  -pa, --plot_apriori   Generate bar plots displaying the values of single-
                        criterion and total analogy between the target volcano
                        and any 'a priori' analogues chosen by the user.
  -S, --save_figures    Save all generated figures
  -V, --version         Print PyVOLCANS package version and exit
```

Calling PyVOLCANS with a volcano name returns the 10 top analogue volcanoes:

```
$ pyvolcans Hekla

Top 10 analogue volcanoes for Hekla, Iceland (372070):

## Community

### For users

The best way to get in touch to ask questions, submit bug reports or contribute code is by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans/issues) in this repository.

### For developers

To modify the code, first clone the PyVOLCANS repository into your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/pyvolcans
```

Then move to the root directory of the project (`pyvolcans`, which contains the `setup.py` file - 
please also check the `requirements.txt` file for a full list of dependencies in the code),
and run the following command to install PyVOLCANS in development mode, preferably within a
clean virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

The `-e` flag makes the files in the current working directory available
throughout the virtual environment and, therefore, changes are reflected straight away.
With this installation, it is no longer required to set the PYTHONPATH.

The `[dev]` part installs packages required for development e.g. `pytest`.

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest -v test
```
