Description: # Open-access VOLCANS
        
        Collaborative effort to create an free-software (Python), open-access version of VOLCANS (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00445-019-1336-3). 1st stage: provide the users with results from VOLCANS. 2nd stage: clean, re-test and open the whole VOLCANS code
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pyvolcans` can be imported to a new environment as follows:
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://gitlab.com/PTierz/pyvolcans.git
        ```
        
        It is necessary to have git installed and on the system path.  You will be
        asked for your GitLab username and password.
        
        This method adds `pyvolcans` to the virtual environment PATH so that it can be
        used from any directory.
        
        
        ## Local development setup
        
        In a clean virtual environment, run the following from the root directory of
        the project to install `pyvolcans` in development mode.
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install -e .[dev]
        ```
        
        The `-e` flag makes the files in the current working directory available
        throughout the virtual environment and so changes are reflected straight away.
        With this installation, it is no longer required to set the PYTHONPATH.
        
        The `[dev]` part installs packages required for development e.g. `pytest`.
        
        Run tests with:
        
        ```bash
        pytest -vs test
        ```
