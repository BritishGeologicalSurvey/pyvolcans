    Make some minor modifications on the output format

commit a916d81fa88d15261593ce914a9e5ce161ed9cde

    Add some formatted output to be displayed on the terminal
    
    Note that this is a preliminary solution. The main reason to
    implement this formatted output was to add the multi-criteria
    analogy value in the outputs because, given two or more analogues
    with the same value of analogy, the ordering in Python is not
    entirely clear so double-checking with other documents, including
    Tierz et al. (2019), can be difficult.

    Modify the argparse section to input strings instead of float/int
    
    NB. The conversion from str to int of the 'count' argument will be
    part of the next commit.

    Move the loading of the mat files to the pyvolcans_func.py
    
    For now, we will load the Matlab matrices inside the function:
    'calculate_weighted_analogy_matrix'. This avoids 'back-dependency'
    issues between 'pyvolcans.py' and 'pyvolcans_func.py' and makes
    the program to run correctly. Further tests are going to be carried
    out using the following volcanoes and weighting schemes:
    Gede-Pangrango (schemes B, C, E), Aluto (schemes Al1, Al4),
    Sinabung (scheme C), Fuego (schemes B, C), Kilauea (schemes B, C)

    Modify argparse section to include 'analogy functions'
    
    Dictionary of weights has been defined using the arguments
    input by the PyVOLCANS user via the command line.
    Note that 'tectonic_analogy' and other variables are not
    being see by 'calculate_weighted_analogy_matrix' function
    in pyvolcans_func.py

    Finish get_analogies function and run a few tests
    
    The tests mainly consisted on double-checking for the match
    between the results obtained with the current version of
    PyVOLCANS and the Matlab version of VOLCANS, considering sets
    of Top 10/20 analogue volcanoes with scheme A (equal weight)
    and for the following target volcanoes: Fuego, Kilauea, Okmok,
    Cleveland, and Gede-Pangrango. All tests were successful.

    Repeat previous commit because it is not clear it worked properly
    
    Note that both the argparse section and the get_analogies
    function need to be properly finished in following commits

    Finish building the function to calculate weighted (total) analogies
    
    The function has been preliminarily tested just by manually exploring
    different elements on the diagonal of the criterion-specific matrices
    (e.g. tectonic setting, geochemistry, etc.) and on the final weighted
    -analogy matrix; as well as by double-checking that the top10
    analogue volcanoes to Fuego (Guatemala), for scheme A in Tierz et al.
    (2019) -i.e. all criteria are used, with equal weight-, yielded values
    of total analogy decreasing from the top1 to the top10 volcanoes.
    All manual tests performed have been passed.
    More specific ('automatic') tests will be required in the near future.

    Handle errors for duplicate volcano names
    
    Here we replaced the try and catch by if statements
    to handle errors related to duplicated volcano names.
    Further development of this error handling is expected.
